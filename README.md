# Virtual-3D

In this project, I will create a virtual three dimensional display using face tracking to track a person's head. Furthermore, I will use the Haar Cascade face tracker from OpenCV to determine the x, y, z, location of a person relative to the webcam. I will then change the display of the virtual tunnel depending on the persons position so that it appears in 3d.
